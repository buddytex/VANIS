# VANIS
A completely useless project with absolutely no real-world purpose. Updated regularly for no reason other than to keep the green contribution squares happy.

# ðŸŒ€ The Useless Project

## ðŸ“Œ About
This project serves absolutely no practical purpose.  
It exists purely for:
- Practicing Git commits  
- Feeding the GitHub contribution graph  
- Pretending to be productive  

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Whatever I feel like at the moment
- Runs on Windows because... why not?
- GitHub, because the cloud is just someone elseâ€™s computer

## ðŸ“… Update Frequency
- Whenever I remember  
- Or when the green squares start disappearing

## ðŸš€ How to Run
You donâ€™t. Seriously, donâ€™t.

## ðŸ“œ License
Do whatever you want. Itâ€™s useless anyway.
